# Example

This example shows how to integrate a custom Hathor token to the demo Unity game. This will draw tokens from a central wallet and distribute it to the player's wallet. In this example, the player's wallet will be hardcoded in the config file. In a real integration, each player should be allocated a wallet address dynamically.

## Requirements

1. Hathor Headless wallet installed and running. This should be loaded and have tokens available. You can use any custom token or HTR. For information on how to run a headless wallet click [here](https://github.com/HathorNetwork/hathor-wallet-headless)
2. Unity Hub;
3. Text Editor

8. Save the file

### Adding Token payments to the game
1. On your assets open the 3dGameKit, Scenes, GamePlay directory
2. Select and open the Level1 file
3. Once it opens, on your assets go to the HathorUnity, Prefabs directory
4. Select the HathorCountFloatingText.prefab file
5. Drag the file to the Level1, System on the Hierarchy list.
6. On your assets go to 3DGameKit, Prefabs, Characters, Ellen and select Ellen.prefab
7. Open the file
8. On the Inspector window, go to the end of the file and click on Add Component
9. On the New component window, select HathorPlayer

11. Paste the wallet address on the WalletPlayer field
12. Save the file
13. On your assets select 3DGameKit, Scripts, Game, Enemies, Chomper directory
14. On the directory open the ChomperBehaviour.cs file

```csharp
using UnityEngine;

using UnityHathor;  // add this line

public static readonly int hashIdleState = Animator.StringToHash("ChomperIdle");

//Hathor - Start Variables Block
public GameObject hathorCountPopup;
public GameObject playerObject;
//Hathor - End Variables Block
```

17. Add code to transfer tokens inside death or destroy functions (around line 243)
```csharp
// Inside your death or destroy functions
// Hathor - Grab the wallet inserted in the character wallet
var walletPlayer = playerObject.GetComponent<HathorPlayer>().walletPlayer;

// generate a random value between 0 and 5 where 5 is 0.05 tokens
int hathorAmount = UnityEngine.Random.Range(0, 5);

// Hathor - Check if hathorCountPopup is no null
if (hathorCountPopup)
{
    // Hathor - Shows the amount of coins received
    HathorQueue.ShowHathorCountPopup(hathorCountPopup, hathorAmount, transform);
}

// Hathor - If the value is below or equal zero, do not attempt to transact
if (hathorAmount > 0)
{                
    // Hathor - Create a new struct with the player wallet and the value to be transacted
    HathorTransactStruct newTx = new HathorTransactStruct(walletPlayer, hathorAmount);
    // Hathor - Add the new struct to the transaction queue
    HathorQueue.transactsQueue.Enqueue(newTx);               
}
```
